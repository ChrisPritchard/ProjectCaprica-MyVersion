# ProjectCaprica-MyVersion

Following along with Quill18Create's Project Caprica tutorials (with some changes and tweaks).

Starts with video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4XqPdaPUAg, and has eight segments (so far, but for at least the last year or so).

Also serves as a gentle, but more than basic, re-introduction to Unity for me after a while away.
